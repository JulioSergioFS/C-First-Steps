# C-First-Steps

Starting to learn C language to college.
Using the video "C Programming Tutorial for Beginners" from the freeCodeCamp.org Youtube channel to learn.

The exercise at the Giraffe folder are from the video, and the exercises at the *exercicios* folder are exercises from college. The ones that have the "*" might be wrong tho.
